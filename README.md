# Playwright
Web scraping for sites with dynamic content and infinite scroll pagination.

This project demonstrates how to use Playwright, a Node.js library, for scraping dynamic websites. Playwright allows us to automate browsers, navigate pages, and extract data, even from websites that rely on JavaScript for rendering content.

**Features**
1. Scrapes websites with dynamic content (AJAX, JavaScript-rendered data).
2. Supports infinite scroll or pagination handling to scrape multiple pages.
3. Ability to interact with page elements like buttons, forms, and dropdowns.
4. Data extraction into structured formats such as JSON or CSV.
